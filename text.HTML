<h1>Juice wrld - all girls are the same.</h1>
<p> 
ALL GIRLS ARE THE SAME
LORDRONIN

<p>
Valentine in December
You said you love me but you don't remember
My name
You cause me pain
All girls are the same
</p>

<p>
I don’t love you now
All girls are the same
I don't need you now
All girls are the same
</p>

<p>
All of these demons, they're dancin’ inside
I don't know whether to live or to die
But I keep fighting, that feeling inside
I'm gonna ride, gonna ride till I die
Sorry my homies I left to the side
Do you ever think of suicide?
Fuck all this pain you can see in my eyes
You're fucking around, you gone pay with your life
</p>
